Quotes from Effective Java (2nd edition) by Joshua Bloch

When use:
the Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes
whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of
parameters

Advantages:
- Base Class is immutable, and all parameter default values
    are in a single location. The builderâ€™s setter methods return the builder itself so
    that invocations can be chained.
- This client code is easy to write and, more importantly, to read
- A minor advantage of builders over constructors is that builders can have multiple
    varargs parameters. Constructors, like methods, can have only one varargs
    parameter.
- The Builder pattern is flexible. A single builder can be used to build multiple
  objects.
- Client code is much easier to read and write with builders than with the traditional telescoping
    constructor pattern, and builders are much safer than JavaBeans

Disadvantages:
- the cost of creating the builder is unlikely to be noticeable in practice,
    it could be a problem in some performance-critical situations.
- Builder pattern is more verbose than the telescoping constructor pattern
