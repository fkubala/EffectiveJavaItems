Quotes from Effective Java (2nd edition) by Joshua Bloch

Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

Advantages:
- One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they
  have names.
- A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors,
  they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked.
- It can greatly improve performance if
  equivalent objects are requested often, especially if they are expensive to create.
- Another advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors,
  they can return an object of any subtype of their return type
- they reduce the verbosity of creating parameterized type instances

Disadvantages:
- The main disadvantage of providing only static factory methods is that
  classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.
- A second disadvantage of static factory methods is that they are not
  readily distinguishable from other static methods

Common names:
  valueOf , of , getInstance , newInstance , getType , newType
